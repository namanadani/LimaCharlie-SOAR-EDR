#Project overview
This project highlights the seamless integration of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to streamline security workflows and strengthen an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity posture. By leveraging **LimaCharlie** for EDR and **Tines** for SOAR, it delivers real-time security insights and automated responses to swiftly tackle threats.
The project focuses on detecting and mitigating credential access attacks using the **LaZagne** tool. When LimaCharlie identifies LaZagne activity on endpoint devices, it instantly triggers alerts and remediation actions. Users can also decide whether to isolate compromised machines, adding a layer of control to automated processes. 
To ensure a fast and effective response, the system integrates with **Slack** and **email** for instant communication, keeping security teams informed and responsive. This combination of automation, real-time detection, and adaptable workflows demonstrates a modern, proactive approach to security operations.
